# Domino Library

A small C++17 library.

Talk is cheap. Use $\color{red}{\textsf{AI}}$ to show you the library details:
- What
  - Code comments explain the design intent.
  - Each UT is an executable real-world requirement.
- How
- Quality/proficiency
  - **[SafePtr](src/safe_mem) AI benchmark:** Given only its [UTs](ut/safe_mem), Claude Opus 4.5 rebuilt SafePtr and passed all tests. Under the same rubric: **SafePtr 92/100; AI baseline 68/100**.

## Components

- **Domino**
  - **Problem:** such as OS-upgrade, involves many interdependent conditions & tasks.
  - Each condition is a domino tile, and their dependencies form a DAG.
  - A condition satisfied = a tile falls → auto-broadcasts to downstream (domino).
  - A task can stick to 1 tile - when the tile falls, auto-execute the task.
  - **Result:** improved eNB-base-station-upgrade $\color{blue}{\textsf{from}\sim9\textsf{min to}\sim1\textsf{min}}$.

- **ObjAnywhere:** feed into AI for details.

- **MsgSelf** is a priority FIFO queue...

- **SafePtr** is safer than std::shared_ptr

- **SmartLog**

- **ThreadBack:** time-cost event running in a separate thread → callback main thread

## Engineering Evidence

- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/nokia/domino-library/actions/workflows/ci.yml)
  runs GoogleTest under Valgrind on pushes, pull requests, and a weekly schedule.
- [Full line & branch coverage](ut/gcovr/gcovr.cfg).
- [`ut/`](ut) each UT case is an end-to-end scenario.
- The currently verified CI environment is **Ubuntu + GCC**.

## Build and Run

Requirements: CMake 3.14 or newer and a C++17-capable compiler.

Ask AI for details.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Changes should include or update unit
tests; the existing tests are the primary usage examples.
